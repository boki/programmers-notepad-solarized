Solarized - Programmer’s Notepad preset
=======================================

Visit the [Solarized homepage]
------------------------------

See the [Solarized homepage] for screenshots, 
details and colorscheme versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal emulators and 
other applications.


Installation
------------

Copy the xml files into the Programmer's Notepad\presets folder and select the
preset in the Options dialog in the "Fonts and Colours/Styles" branch.

Note: currently there seems to be a bug in Programmer’s Notepad that resets the
font size when switching presets so you might want to check it on the
"Fonts and Colours" branch.
